character has many attributes
one of that is relation, relation is an array in which each element is also an array

in relations we have relation_name, a brief description of what it entails and an automatically generated _id
when entering a fresh character for each of it's relation we fill in two details
the character name and the relation shared along with it
based on the name of the relation we enter automatically we must map that _id
